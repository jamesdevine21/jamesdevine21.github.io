	<p>Born in Cypress, California on December 30, 1975, Eldrick Tont <i>"Tiger"</i> Woods has always had a future in golf. 
	As a young child, he was featured on a major talk show as a new golf prodigy ready to take on the
	world by storm. Under careful watch from his father Earl, Tiger raced through the US Amateur golf tournaments
	which solidified him as the future of the sport to many current players and TV analysts. After completing his
	youth career with multiple impressive wins including the 1994 US Amateur Championship, 1994 Eisenhower Trophy, and
	1995 Walker Cup. Tiger continued his promising career at Stanford University, where he won the NCAA Individual
	Championship. After two years, Woods decided to take his career to the next level and turn professional. At just 20
	years old, Woods was one of the youngest players on the PGA Tour. </p>
	
	<p>However, he quickly made his way up the rankings
	through his first major win at the 1997 Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. Woods won the tournament by a dominant
	12 strokes to become the youngest Masters winner ever. Soon after, Tiger became one of the most dominant players in recent
	history as he climbed to the number one overall ranking in 1997, and recorded multiple impressive feats including winning 
	six consecutive events on tour, becoming the youngest player to achieve the career grand slam, and obtaining the largest
	margin of victory in a major ever at the 2000 US Open. </p> <p> Tiger continued to dominate the tour for the following years,
	as he spent an unprecedented 264 weeks at the number one ranking along with compiling 79 PGA Tour wins. Woods' success
	can be found through his uncanny ability to generate incredible swing speeds along with a significant athletic advantage
	over the other golfers on tour. In one of his most memorable moments on tour, Tiger holed a seemingly impossible chip along
	the short grass surrounding the 16th green at the Masters in 2005 in order to secure a fourth win at this prestigous event.</p>
